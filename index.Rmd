## Bio

My name is Bailey Spiegelberg. I grew up in St. Lucia, a small tropical island
in the Caribbean. I have taken three stats classes but have limited experience
of analysing data in R. After this class, I am hoping that I will be able to use
R to analyse my data. 

## Education

PhD in Human Genetics | August 2021 - December 2026 (Expected)

## Fun Facts 

1. I represented St. Lucia as a national swimmer and competed for 15 years. 
   My best race was the open water 5k.
2. I love to cook. 
3. I am happiest by the water, preferably the ocean.
4. My husband and I have a garden every summer. This year we had more peppers 
   than we knew what to do with.
5. St. Lucia just won their first Olympic medal.

St. Lucia is a small island of 180,000 people. Before this summer, we have never
won an Olympic medal. Thanks to Julien Alfred, we now have two. Gold and Silver âœ¨.
She won the 100m track and came second in the 200m track. St. Lucia had the second
most medals per capita at the Paris 2024 games. We were only behind Dominica, 
who had the most medals per capita, with one gold. Also Dominica's first Olympic medal.
